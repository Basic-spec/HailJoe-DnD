		<description>
			<p>A tall human figure strides through the dimly lit temple, clad in tattered robes and bearing a whip. His eyes gleam with fervent devotion as he approaches the altar, ready to enact the will of Haldir upon his own flesh.</p>
			<p class="indent">A human, her body adorned with ritual scars, kneels before the shrine, her face a mask of solemn determination. With each lash of the whip, she offers penance for her sins, seeking absolution in the ecstasy of pain.</p>
			<p class="indent">Frothing at the mouth, a dwarf clad in chains beats his chest in a fervent display of devotion, his chants echoing through the sacred halls. With each strike, he seeks to cleanse his soul of impurity and draw closer to the divine.</p>
			<p class="indent">These flagellants, diverse as they may be, are bound by their unwavering dedication: a relentless pursuit of spiritual enlightenment through self-inflicted suffering. Their devotion is not a mere act of worship, but a profound communion with the divine, a path to transcendence through agony.</p>
			<p class="indent">For some, their fervor stems from a deep-seated belief in the cleansing power of pain. Others embrace suffering as a means of atonement for past transgressions. Yet, for all flagellants, their faith is a beacon of light in the darkness, guiding them through the trials of mortal existence.</p>
			<h4>PATH OF THE PENITENT</h4>
			<p>People of civilized lands may recoil at the sight of self-flagellation, viewing it as a barbaric practice born of ignorance and superstition. But to a follower of Haldir, it is a sacred rite, a testament to their unwavering devotion to the divine will. In the hallowed halls of their temples, flagellants seek to purify their souls through acts of penance, striving to attain spiritual enlightenment through the crucible of suffering.</p>
			<p class="indent">Flagellants find solace in the ecstasy of pain, embracing each lash of the whip as a divine blessing. Through their suffering, they seek to transcend the limitations of the mortal flesh, drawing closer to the divine perfection embodied by Haldir himself.</p>
			<h4>A LIFE OF DEVOTION</h4>
			<p>Not every worshipper of Haldir chooses the path of the flagellant. Some may serve as priests or clerics, guiding their flocks in matters of faith and doctrine. Yet, for those who walk the path of the penitent, self-flagellation is not merely a religious practice, but a way of life.</p>
			<p class="indent">In the sacred precincts of their temples, flagellants devote themselves wholeheartedly to the service of Haldir, forsaking worldly pleasures in pursuit of spiritual enlightenment. They eschew comfort and luxury, embracing hardship and suffering as the truest expressions of their devotion.</p>
			<h4>CREATING A BARBARIAN</h4>
			<p>When creating a flagellant character, consider the depth of your character's faith and their commitment to the path of the penitent. Discuss with your DM the origins of your flagellant's devotion and the role they play in the world.</p>
			<p class="indent">What led you to embrace the path of the flagellant? Were you drawn to the divine teachings of Haldir from a young age, or did you come to the faith later in life? Have you always been a devout follower, or did some life-changing event spur you to seek redemption through self-flagellation?</p>
			<h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
