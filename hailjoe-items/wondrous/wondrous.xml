    <description>

The helmet is adorned with intricate silver and gold filigree, and the visor is inlaid with a clear crystal that glimmers in the light. The wearer of this helmet feels a powerful surge of energy, as if the spirit of an ancient warrior has been awakened within them.</p>

        <li>If the user reduces an enemy to 0 hit points with a melee attack, they gain temporary hit points equal to their fighter level + their Wisdom modifier.</li>
        <li>The user is immune to the Frightened condition.</li>
        <li>The user gains resistance to psychic damage.</li>
        <li>Once per day, the user can invoke the power of the Kabuto's Helmet to enter a state of heightened awareness. While in this state, the user gains the following benefits for 1 minute:</li>
      </ul>

  <element name="Cursed Hammer of the Fallen Blacksmith" type="Magic Item" source="HailJoe Items" id="ID_HAILJOE_CHOTFB">
    <description>
      <p>This hammer appears to be a well-worn blacksmith's hammer, but upon closer inspection, its craftsmanship is far superior to any mortal creation. The hammer's head is made of a gleaming silver metal, and the handle is carved from a rare wood that is said to have magical properties. The hammer seems to almost vibrate with power in the hands of a skilled blacksmith.</p>
      <p>Effect: When a blacksmith wielding the Cursed Hammer of the Fallen Blacksmith creates a weapon or armor, they gain the following benefits:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The time required to create the item is halved.</li>
        <li>The final product is of exceptional quality, granting a +1 bonus to its AC or attack and damage rolls.</li>
        <li>The final product is imbued with a minor magical enchantment of the DM's choice, appropriate to the item being crafted.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Additionally, while holding the Cursed Hammer of the Fallen Blacksmith, the user gains the following benefits:</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
          <li>The user gains proficiency in the Smith's Tools if they do not already have it.</li>
          <li>The user can cast the <em>identify</em> spell once per day as a ritual, without expending a spell slot.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This hammer has 1d4+1 charges. The user can invoke the power of the Cursed Hammer of the Fallen Blacksmith and uses 1 charge of the hammer to create an exceptional masterpiece. When doing so, the user must spend 12 hours crafting a single weapon or armor. The final product is of very rare quality, granting a +2 bonus to its AC or its attack and damage rolls, and is imbued with a powerful magical enchantment of the DM's choice, appropriate to the item being crafted.</p>
      <p>However, the Cursed Hammer of the Fallen Blacksmith has a malevolent curse that afflicts its user. Whenever the user creates an item with the hammer, there is a chance that the item will become corrupted and unstable. Roll a d4. On a roll of 1-2, the item created is cursed and has a detrimental effect on its user or whoever wields it. The nature of the curse is up to the DM's discretion and can range from minor annoyances to major setbacks.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the user's own creations begin to turn against them. Any item created by the user using the Cursed Hammer of the Fallen Blacksmith has a chance to turn on its creator. Roll a d4. On a roll of 1-2, the item becomes sentient and seeks to harm the user or whoever wields it.</p>

  <element name="Lunar Predator's Claw Tattoo" type="Magic Item" source="HailJoe Items" id="ID_HAILJOE_LPCT">
    <description>
      <p>Produced by a special needle, this tattoo once was called as Eldritch Claw Tattoo. After a special regard becomes a demand for "Vague Trader" -a drow thy liveth in Saphentitte-, this magic tattoo transformed to depicts clawlike forms and to other jagged shapes.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Tattoo Attunement.</em></strong> To attune to this item, you hold the needle to your skin where you want the tattoo to appear, pressing the needle there throughout the attunement process. When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin.</p>
			<p class="indent">If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Magical Strikes.</em></strong> While the tattoo is on your skin, your unarmed strikes are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming immunity and resistance to nonmagical attacks, and you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with unarmed strikes.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Lunar Predator's Maul.</em></strong> As a bonus action, you can empower the tattoo for 1 minute. For the duration, each of your melee attacks with a weapon or an unarmed strike can reach a target up to 15 feet away from you, as inky tendrils launch toward the target. In addition, on a hit, your melee attacks deal an extra force damage equal to your hemocraft die depending on your level. Once this feature is used, this bonus action can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Lycanthropic Empowerment.</em></strong> The tattoo resonates with the primal power of lycanthropy, enhancing your bestial abilities. While empowered by the Eldritch Claw Tattoo, the features of your Lycan transformation gain the following benefits:</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Enhanced Claws.</em></strong> The damage of your Crimson Rite-infused claw attacks, starts to shreds the skin and sunder the veins and starts victim to bleed up until thy remains bone and dust. This bleed effect, inflicts an extra necrotic damage equal to your hemocraft die depending on your level to its victim at the start of the victims turn. At the end of the victims turn, the victim rolls a Constitution Saving Throw equal to your hemocraft DC to end its effect.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Bloodhunter's Vigor.</em></strong> As an action, you can expend hit points equal to two times of your Bloodhunter level to regain one use of your Lunar Predator's Maul feature. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
      <p class="indent"><i><b>Curse of Eternal Bond.</b></i> Once attuned to this tattoo, the user finds that attempts to remove it are futile. Any effort to erase, dispel, or magically remove the tattoo is met with resistance, causing intense pain and leaving the tattoo untouched. Additionally, the tattoo cannot be covered or concealed by any means; it always remains visible.</p>
      <p>All Effects of the Curse of the Eternal Bond:</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Painful Removal.</em></strong> If the user attempts to magically remove or dispel the tattoo, they suffer excruciating pain, taking 12d6 psychic damage.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Inescapable Mark.</em></strong> Any attempts to cover or conceal the tattoo magically are unsuccessful. It always remains visible, even through illusions.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Persistent Presence.</em></strong> Even if the user dies and is brought back to life, independently from body, the tattoo reappears on their new or old body.</p>
