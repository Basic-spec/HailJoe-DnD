            <p>After consuming the heart of the defeated Lunar Lycanthropy Werewolf Alpha, "The All Devourer" undergoes a transformative experience, gaining a potent mutational power-up with both benefits and drawbacks.</p>
            <p class="indent"><i><b>Enhanced Vigor:</b></i> Your Constitution score increases by +2, maximum of 22, and you gain advantage on Constitution saving throws.</p>
            <p class="indent"><i><b>Necrotic Resilience:</b></i> You gain resistance to necrotic damage, and you can use your reaction to absorb necrotic energy, healing for half the damage you would have taken.</p>
            <p class="indent"><i><b>Uncontrollable Transformation:</b></i> During periods of a full moon or when exposed to intense moonlight, you must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, you unwillingly transform into a werewolf for 1 hour, losing control of your actions. Your alignment temporarily shifts to chaotic evil nonetheless during these transformations.</p>
            <p class="indent"><i><b>Lunar Dependency:</b></i> You become reliant on moonlight to maintain your strength. In the absence of moonlight, you suffer a -2 penalty to all of your ability scores and deal 1d8 necrotic damage to yourself at the start of each of your turns. You can't benefit long or short rest in this situation. This effect is negated as soon as you are exposed to moonlight again.</p>

        <description>
            <p>This technique is bestowed upon the practitioners by the ancient spirits of the Wolf Father. By invoking this technique, the practitioner enters a state of deep inner dormancy akin to the tranquility of glacial stillness.</p>
            <p class="indent"><i><b>Tranquility:</b></i> In this state, the mind becomes impervious to the chaotic influences of rage and fury, allowing for unparalleled focus and concentration amidst the storm of battle. You gain +2 to Insight checks.</p>
            <p class="indent"><i><b>Essence Circuit Disruption:</b></i> You force your opponents weak will to shut its state. Upon usage, you can force a creature that is within a reach of you to roll a Wisdom Saving Throw. If they fail this throw, the creature becomes loosened and lost its concentration with ongoing state. For your next attack rolls against this creature becomes advantaged. You can use this feature number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
