		<description>
			<p>All barbarians carry a form of fury within them. However, hailing from a barbarian culture entails more than simply relying on courage and strength on the battlefield. On the contrary, barbarians often employ hit-and-run tactics, stealth maneuvers, ambushes, and lightning strikes when combating regular armies. Consequently, those who specialize in this flexible style of combat are often significantly more lethal.</p>
			<p>The Whistle represents an ancient and secretive method of focus, akin to entering a battle trance. Barbarians who follow the path of the whistle utilize custom-made, elegant weapons rather than cumbersome ones. When they enter a rage, their mobility increases, and they provide support to nearby allies. Their most notable characteristic, setting them apart from other barbarians, is their superior agility and expertise in stealth.</p>

			<p>Starting at 10th level, you master the sacred battle trance known as "The Whistle." While you are raging, you can unleash this powerful technique by whistling in a strange yet commanding tone. As you do, you emanate a 15-foot radius aura of focus around you.</p>
			<p class="indent">Within this aura, friendly creatures gain the benefit of adding your Rage Damage bonus to every weapon attack they make. Conversely, hostile creatures within the aura have your Rage Damage bonus subtracted from every weapon attack they make. This effect lasts as long as your rage persists.</p>
