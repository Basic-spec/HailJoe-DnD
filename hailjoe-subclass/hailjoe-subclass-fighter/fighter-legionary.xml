			<p>In the context of warfare, victory hinges on logistical prowess, high morale, discipline, and strategic acumen. Professional armies hold a distinct advantage over conscripted forces or scattered militias. Nobles often raise their own armies, and there exists a multitude of professional soldiers, including mercenaries. However, none can rival the esteemed legions of the Empire.</p>
			<p>Imperial legions epitomize disciplined warfare, seamlessly executing military structure and employing advanced tactics. Officers undergo rigorous training to make sound decisions, maintain composure amidst chaos, and facilitate effective communication. A warrior imbued with such training is destined to serve as both guardian and leader, whether within the ranks of a legion or beyond.</p>

			<p>When you choose this subclass at 3rd level, you have a calm and tactical presence on the battlefield. You read your foes as well as your allies. Although an adventuring party differs from an army, engagement tactics may still provide an edge. At the start of combat, you can swap the result of your initiative roll with an ally or an enemy that you can see. You and the target of this feature swap places on the turn orders for the entire fight. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, after 6th level, you and five other creatures you choose have advantage on initiative rolls.</p>
