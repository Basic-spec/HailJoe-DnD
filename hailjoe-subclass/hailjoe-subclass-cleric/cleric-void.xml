			<p>All gods claim some aspects of creation as their domain and their devoted clerics work according to their gods’ definitive nature. But not all gods have interest in the created things. Some forces beyond the veil see all of the creation as weak and disgusting. There are gods that favor destruction of course, but destruction and chaos in itself is a “thing” at the end. But there are some beings that only crave the peace of the nothingness.</p>
			<p>For the unsophisticated, these concepts may seem familiar by judging the results and methods of their followers. But the urge to kill is not the same as the craving of silence. These kinds of divine beings usually don’t get many followers among mortals, due to every creature’s essential desire to exist. However, there are cults consisting of nihilistic individuals. Some have hope for new beginnings after the total annihilation, some don’t even have that. They just believe existing causes pain and there is serenity in void.</p>
