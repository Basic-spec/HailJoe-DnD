        <description>
            <p>At your command, the lifeless body of a recently deceased creature swiftly swells and bursts into a horrifying explosion. You choose a corpse of a creature that has been lifeless for no more than 1 minute that you can see within range, triggering an explosion. Each creature within a 10-footradius sphere centered on that corpse must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 3d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
            <p class="indent">The size of the explosion increases by 5 feet for every size larger than medium.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels. </i></b>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You manipulate the shadow of a creature you can see within range according to your will. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or its shadow animates into a malevolent attacker. For the duration, the shadow stays attached to the target, sharing its space and constantly hindering it, granting advantage on all attacks against it. On each of your turns for the duration, you can use your action to deal 2d6 necrotic damage to the target automatically.</p>
            <p class="indent">At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels. </i></b>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>

            <p>For the duration, you gain the ability to read non-magical texts at a rate of 100 pages per minute.

            <p>You reach out and touch the corpse of a creature. Within a minute, the corpse rapidly begins to decompose. It becomes covered in fungi and mold, but during this process, no odor emanates. All the water in the body disappears, and at the end of the duration, only a handful of dust remains from the corpse.</p>
            <p class="indent">The spell’s target corpse count increases when you reach 5th level 4, 11th level 16, and 17th level it becomes a pile of corpses with indefinite amount.</p>

            <p>Using the instrument in your hand, you produce a simple sound. Within the range of the spell, at the location you pointed to, five barely visible, translucent ghostly figures appear.</p>
            <p class="indent">These figures, aside from their pale colors, resemble well-dressed bards and play the songs you desire with perfect flawlessness throughout the duration.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You awaken the sense of mortality in one creature you can see within range. A construct or an undead is immune to this effect. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you until the spell ends. If the save fails by 5 or more, the target also ages 1d4 × 10 years. The frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>
            <p class="indent">The aging effect can be reversed with a greater restoration spell, but only within 24 hours of its occurrence. Otherwise, it can only be reversed with the "Wish" spell.</p>
