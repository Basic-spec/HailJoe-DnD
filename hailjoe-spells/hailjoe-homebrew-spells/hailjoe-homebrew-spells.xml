        <description>
            <p>At your command, the lifeless body of a recently deceased creature swiftly swells and bursts into a horrifying explosion. You choose a corpse of a creature that has been lifeless for no more than 1 minute that you can see within range, triggering an explosion. Each creature within a 10-footradius sphere centered on that corpse must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 3d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
            <p class="indent">The size of the explosion increases by 5 feet for every size larger than medium.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels. </i></b>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.</p>

            <p>You awaken the sense of mortality in one creature you can see within range. A construct or an undead is immune to this effect. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you until the spell ends. If the save fails by 5 or more, the target also ages 1d4 × 10 years. The frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>
            <p class="indent">The aging effect can be reversed with a greater restoration spell, but only within 24 hours of its occurrence. Otherwise, it can only be reversed with the "Wish" spell.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You create a sudden eruption of acidic energy at a point you can see within range. Each creature within a 10-foot radius of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d4 acid damage, and their skin is temporarily weakened, causing them to take an additional 1d4 acid damage at the start of each of their turns for the duration of the spell, or until they take an action to wipe off the acid. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and is not affected by the ongoing acid damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">While you maintain concentration on this spell, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to move the point of origin up to 30 feet in any direction. Any creature that starts its turn within the area of effect must make the initial Dexterity saving throw, even if they have already taken damage from the spell.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels. </i></b>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the initial damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 3rd. Additionally, the ongoing acid damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 3rd.</p>

        <supports>Cleric, Druid, Warlock</supports>
        <description>
            <p>You point at a non-magical weapon within range and curse it with the bane of blades. The weapon begins to rust and corrode, losing its edge and becoming useless in combat. For the duration of the spell, targeted nonmagical weapons that are held by creatures or that are not being worn or carried take damage from rust and corrosion at the end of their wielder's turn. The number of turns a weapon can withstand this spell without breaking depends on the material of the weapon, as shown in the table below:</p>
            <table>
				<thead>
					<tr><td class="left">Material</td><td>Durability(Turns)</td></tr>
				</thead>
				<tr><td class="left">Wood</td><td>1</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="left">Bone</td><td>1</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="left">Stone</td><td>2</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="left">Iron</td><td>3</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="left">Bronze</td><td>4</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="left">Silver</td><td>4</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="left">Gold</td><td>5</td></tr>
                <tr><td class="left">Steel</td><td>5</td></tr>
			</table>
            <p class="indent">If a weapon's durability is reduced to zero, it is destroyed. If the wielder of a weapon affected by this spell leaves the area of the spell, the spell ends for the weapon, and the weapon reverts back to its undamaged version. If a weapon is destroyed before the end of the spell, it is destroyed permanently. Additionally, if a weapon is thrown or moved outside of the spell's area of effect, the spell ends on that weapon. You cannot target the same weapon multiple times with this spell, even if you cast it with a higher-level spell slot. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the number of weapons you can target increases by one for each spell slot level above 2nd.</p>

            <p>You seek guidance from the fates by performing the ancient ritual of spilling molten lead into water. When you cast this spell, you heat up the lead until it becomes molten, and then pour it into the vessel of water</p>
            <p class="indent">As the molten lead cools and solidifies in the water, it forms unique shapes and patterns that can be interpreted as omens or messages from the divine. You can make an Intelligence check to interpret the significance of the shapes and patterns, with the DC determined by the GM based on the complexity of the interpretation.</p>
            <p class="indent">The interpretation can provide insight into a specific question or situation you are facing, or it can reveal general guidance or warnings. The interpretation is not always clear or definitive, and the GM has the final say on the outcome of the divination.</p>

            <p class="indent">As you perform the divination, you toss the divination bones or knucklebones, interpreting the patterns and symbols they form to reveal information about future events. The GM provides you with information about potential events that could happen in the near future, such as battles, natural disasters, or political upheavals.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can ask five specific questions about future events or seek general guidance on how to prepare for the future. The GM provides answers to these questions based on the results of the divination, although the answers may be cryptic or vague.</p>
            <p class="indent">Roll a d100 to see the prophetic capabilities of the carcass you are inspecting. If you are using the carcass of a recently dead humanoid, you don't need to roll; the roll is assumed to be a 100 without a roll. Any carcass this spell is cast on cannot be revived with a spell below 7th level. Then roll an Insight check to interpret the results. Interpretation of the results gets harder as the depth of the knowledge you seek increases.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels. </i></b>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the number of questions you can ask increases by 1 for each spell slot above 7th level.</p>

            <p>As an action, you point your finger at a spellcaster. The spellcaster makes a concentration save against your spell save DC. On a failure, the target takes a d4 force damage per the number of spell slots it has.</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, on a failure, the target loses 2d6 spell slots it has starting from the highest level available. If a target drops to 0 hit points as a result of this spell, it bursts into arcane flames and turns to ash.</p>

            <p>You create a burst of healing energy that jumps from creature to creature. Choose a creature within range to be the first target of the spell. That creature regains hit points equal to 3d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier.</p>
            <p class="indent">The spell then jumps to up to three other creatures of your choice within 30 feet of the first target, each of which regains hit points equal to 3d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. The spell can jump to a total of four creatures, and each creature can only be targeted maximum twice.</p>
	    <p class="indent">If any of the creatures you target are undead, they take radiant damage instead of regaining hit points. These targets make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a success, they receive half the damage. On a fail, the damage dealt is equal to the amount of healing they would have received.</p>
	    <p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels. </i></b>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the amount of healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.</p>
