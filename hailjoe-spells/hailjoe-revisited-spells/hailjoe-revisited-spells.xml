        <description>
            <p>At your command, the lifeless body of a recently deceased creature swiftly swells and bursts into a horrifying explosion. You choose a corpse of a creature that has been lifeless for no more than 1 minute that you can see within range, triggering an explosion. Each creature within a 10-footradius sphere centered on that corpse must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 3d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
            <p class="indent">The size of the explosion increases by 5 feet for every size larger than medium.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels. </i></b>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.</p>
