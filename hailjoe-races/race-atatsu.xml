        <description>
            <p class="flavor">I was told the atatsu were born from the molten slag of a bleeding mountain, life bursting forth from the cruellest environment imaginable. Others say they bloomed from the first corpses cut down in war, or emerged fully formed from the silent, chill void. There are one hundred stories of how they came to be, but no matter which you choose to believe, in every tale one theme runs true: the atatsu are life born from death.</p>
            <h4>GAUNT VISAGE</h4>
            <p>With gaunt faces, charcoal skin, and coarse crimson petals, Atatsu are a race of sentient plants believed by many to be harbingers of death.</p>
            <p class="indent">This reputation is not totally unfounded, for atatsu are physiologically sympathetic; their bodies reverberate in harmony with the fleeting spirit of creatures that die in their presence, taking on traits of the deceased for a short time. The slaughter of a mighty beast is felt by its hunters as a surge of physical strength, and the passing of a sage as a transcendent moment of heightened wisdom. As a result, atatsu have a complex relationship with death; to die in their presence is to pass a glimpse of oneself to another, for a short time.</p>
            <h4>REACTIVE PHYSIOLOGY</h4>
            <p>Atatsu’s sympathetic physiology extends to the world around them. While they can briefly share in the physiology of creatures who die, they can permanently take on the physical characteristics of their environment over a longer duration. Humid jungles might impart an atatsu with a permanent scent of rich flora, while icy mountains cause their body to forever be chill to the touch. Atatsu adventurers who travel the world end their lives as a collage of the habitats that succored them, a jigsaw infused with environmental memories ever bonded to their form.</p>
            <h4>BURNING EMOTIONS</h4>
            <p>Atatsu are naturally passionate and active. They think, speak, and adapt swiftly, and are known for their fiery tempers and zealous loyalty. With short lives, atatsu see little value in holding grudges or overanalysing a situation, preferring to think on their feet and revel in the heat of each moment. An atatsu’s emotional state can be read on its body: its petals blush darkly when enraged, and the tips of its branches sprout new buds during periods of prolonged grief. It is said that if an atatsu loses a true love, it will forever bloom.</p>
            <h4>ATATSU NAMES</h4>
            <p>Among the Atatsu, childhood lasts until they affirm their adulthood, a significant milestone that typically occurs after their hundredth year. Prior to this transition, they are referred to by their child names.</p>
            <p class="indent">Upon reaching adulthood, an Atatsu selects an adult name, although those who have known them since childhood might continue using their child name affectionately. Each adult name among the Atatsu is a unique creation, often drawing inspiration from esteemed individuals or other family members. Gender distinctions are subtle in Atatsu names, and the categories provided here only reflect general trends. Additionally, every Atatsu carries a family name, usually formed by combining various terms from their folklore. While some Atatsu interacting with humans might translate their family names into a more common tongue, others prefer to keep the traditional Atatsu version.</p>
